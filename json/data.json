My twist on rgb (red, green, blue) featuring a fuchsia/magenta fusion, mellowed old school screen green, and perfect blue sky. Traditional print inspired black and white with a hint of luxury gold (you might see orange, its digital gold). And for the all important highlight and contrast effect its a buzz of yellow. </p><p>As a colour lover, creating a meaningful, vibrant, and accessible palette was at the heart of the sites design.</p><h3>Size</h3><p>Binary is a numbering system that uses only two digits: 0 and 1. It's the language of computers, where everything is represented using combinations of 0s and 1s. Each digit in binary represents a power of 2, making it fundamental in digital electronics and computing.</p><p>In computing, binary is fundamental as the language of computers, where everything from numbers to text, images, and sound is represented using combinations of 0s and 1s.</p><p>One bit (on this site, a box) can represent two states: typically 0 or 1, or 'off' and 'on'. In computing, it's the smallest unit of data and is used to represent Boolean values (true/false), switch states, or binary digits in binary code. A single bit can convey basic information, such as whether a switch is on or off, whether a condition is true or false, or whether a specific state exists (on this site, a box is inactive until a user triggers it and it becomes active).</p><p>In it's smallest viewport, the mobile view, the boxes are paired. In tablet view they are doubled from 2 to 4 (or halved from 8 to 4 boxes if you shift from desktop view). 4 and 8: They are significant as powers of 2. Computers often organise memory and data in units of 4 or 8 bytes for efficient processing and storage.</p><p>The 8 bit design (8 boxes per row, for every row added) is also a nod to  retro designs.</p><h3>Shape</h3><p>A square. Every side equal. Every side facing a direction. Facing top, left, right, bottom - north, east, south, west.</p><h3>Layout</h3><p>The simple layout is efficiently displayed, fully utilising the entire screen space available. No room for error.</p><h3>Concept</h3><p>The pixel perfect concept was born from the idea from working in digital; pixels are essential components of various digital media, including displays, images, videos, and graphical user interfaces.</p><p>The term 'Pixel Perfect' originated from the importance of pixels in digital media like images, videos, and screens.</p><p>'Pixel Perfect' reflects the pursuit of excellence in digital craftsmanship and user experience, emphasising the importance of fine-tuning and refining design elements to achieve optimal visual clarity and fidelity.</p>",

On one hand, it conjures visions of daunting numbers cascading into infinity, equations so complex they resemble a hangman's noose, and mathematical intricacies that seem to swallow you whole. It's a stark departure from the vibrant, imaginative world my mind typically inhabits.</p><p>Yet, within these binary digits of 0's and 1's lie the very foundations of creation — a digital universe waiting to be explored, understood, and reshaped.</p><h3>Discovery</h3><p>My introduction to CS50 came through a compelling blog post that fervently recommended it during my exploration of programming languages. Intrigued, I delved into the free Harvard course available on the EDX platform, drawn in by its comprehensive curriculum spanning languages such as C, Python, SQL, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.</p><h3>Scratching the Surface</h3><p>The journey commenced at ground zero: 0's and 1's. The initial stages were surprisingly accessible as we were introduced to Scratch — a coding platform designed for youngsters. Our maiden task? Crafting a game using Scratch. Yet, simplicity proved elusive; it demanded experimentation with its diverse coding components. However, witnessing the amalgamation of disparate elements into a functional whole proved gratifying. Feel free to experience my Scratch creation, <span class='clickable inlink' data-link='#box-21' data-target='#quickview-21'>Bug Invasion, here</span>.</p><h3>Pushing Boundaries</h3><p>The subsequent lectures became a litmus test for my cognitive endurance. While visual concepts resonated effortlessly, technical nuances demanded tenacity. While my journey through the course remains ongoing, I am committed to surmounting its challenges.</p><h3>Purposeful Pursuit</h3><p>Embarking on this odyssey was driven by a profound desire to unravel the mysteries of the very tools—computers—that have been integral to my professional pursuits, leisure activities, and everyday life for as long as I can remember. It parallels the revelation of unraveling the layers of a longtime friend, unearthing hidden depths and fostering a newfound intimacy. Armed with insights into the inner workings of technology, one hopes to decipher the origins of enigmatic phenomena like debugging, thus refining the craft of programming, design, and user experience.</p><p>In my exploration of CS50, I've encountered a bridge between the realms of creativity and logic — a fusion of artistry and precision that speaks to the essence of modern innovation. It's a journey of self-discovery, an odyssey into the heart of technology, and an invitation to redefine the boundaries of what's possible.</p>",

This involved investing time in learning new software, exploring emerging trends, and enrolling in an intensive 12-week Software Development Bootcamp.</p><h3>Bootcamp Journey</h3><p>For 3.5 hours a day over 12 weeks, immersion in the world of Software Development occurred alongside approximately 20 other like-minded aspiring software developers.</p><p>The journey commenced with essential tools like VSCode, a significant upgrade from SublimeText. Trainers began with the fundamentals: HTML, Git, and GitHub, swiftly progressing to CSS, and Bootstrap.</p><h3>Intensive Learning</h3><p>The curriculum delved into JavaScript, offering deeper insights beyond prior experience with jQuery and AJAX. Projects like building a Calculator and a trivia quiz named 20 Questions pushed boundaries in both backend and frontend development.</p><p>Next, the focus shifted to backend programming, particularly Databases. Starting with MySQL and traversing through MongoDB, this segment was particularly intriguing. Delving into Python programming culminated in creating a CRUD system using SQLite and Replit, and ultimately developing FilmFlix, a Python CRUD project using Flask.</p><h3>Challenges and Growth</h3><p>Throughout the Bootcamp, regular quizzes tested knowledge, and collaboration opportunities fostered a supportive learning environment. While most assignments were individual, some encouraged teamwork, fostering camaraderie within the cohort.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>By proactively enhancing skills and knowledge, seeking exciting opportunities within the tech sector became the goal.
